      "Here is a simple (Todo) Full-Stack React Application using AWS Amplify. This was achieved by following step by step hands-on tutorial (https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/) on Amazon. The project includes making use of the aws amplify CLI, adding authentication flow to manage users. The project also entails a GraphQL API, a DynamoDB database and Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store images. Further work is done to make it better.",
